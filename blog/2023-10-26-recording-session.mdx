## Looking for all musicials of any genre to apply!
* Individuals or groups welcome
* Do not need to be in a music class at P2P
* Recieve coaching on the process, professional recording, and an album release party
* Sessions available for both fall and spring semesters

Apply to be selected for **FREE studio recording time** generously supported by the [Lafayette Arts in Education grant](https://www.lafayetteco.gov/695/Arts-Grants) and [Dog House Music Studio](https://www.doghousemusic.com)! All applicants must be Peak to Peak students with strong priority to high schoolers.

The opportunity is available for 3-5 musicians who are interested in learning about the recording process from a professional sound engineer. Learning through the process, selected students will plan, rehearse, and then record in a professional music studio. Ms. Shea and the engineers of Dog House Music Studios in Lafayette will work together to create a scaffolded support for you to have a professional-quality recording of your track ready for an album release party at the end of the school year.

Musicians may include individual acts or groups. All genres are welcome! We'd love to see any musical act, but some options include:

- singer-songwriters
- rock bands
- rappers
- classical soloists
- duos
- trios
- bluegrass bands
- any musical act you can think of! Run it by Ms. Shea if you're not sure!

Note: to be officially selected, Ms. Shea will follow up with your parent/guardian after you apply to make sure they are on board as well!
