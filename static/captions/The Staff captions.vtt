Hello!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.300
My name is JP Kerrane, and in this video,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.200
you'll learn how to recognize, draw,
and describe a musical staff.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:18.233
First, what is a staff?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.766
A staff is this empty canvas and music

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.866
which allows you to know how to write down
notes onto a piece of paper.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.333
Just like how the alphabet

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:29.133
allows you to write words,
the staff allows you to write notes.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.466
So, let's try drawing one!

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.633
A staff consists of five evenly spaced
horizontal lines

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.033
one, two, three, four, five, awesome.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
And, a staff also consists of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.300
one, two, three, four spaces.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.366
In the next video, you'll learn
how to write notes on the staff

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.900
and use the staff to express music.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.366
Thanks!
