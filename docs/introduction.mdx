## About theorybear

This guide was put together by [JP Kerrane](https://www.jameskerrane.com), Mr. Henning's TA and a former Puma Pride and Phoenix Fire Choir member! I wanted to create a resource to make it easier to study music theory and prepare for music theory tests in class, since I didn't always understand the music theory books without talking to someone else or checking other resources on the internet.

Hopefully this guide will address any questions you have about your music theory units as you work throughout the year!

### Why "theorybear"?

I named this site "theorybear" because I like bears. Also, music theory is beary fun (sorry not sorry) ;)
