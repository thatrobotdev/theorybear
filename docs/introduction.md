## About theorybear

This guide was put together by [JP Kerrane](https://www.jameskerrane.com), Mr. Henning's TA and a former Puma Pride and Phoenix Fire Choir member! I wanted to create a resource to make it easier to study music theory and prepare for music theory tests in class, since I didn't always understand the music theory books without talking to someone else or checking other resources on the internet. Hopefully this guide will address any questions you have about your music theory units as you work throughout the year!

If you have any suggestions or comments, email me at [jpkerrane01@bvsd.org](mailto:jpkerrane01@bvsd.org)! If you want to help develop this site or add new content, might I suggest joining [P2P Hack Club](https://www.p2phack.club) or the Computer Science National Honor Society to help give back to the rest of the Peak to Peak community through computer science projects! You can also [view and edit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/thatrobotdev/theorybear).

### Why "theorybear"?

I named this site "theorybear" because I like bears. Also, music theory is beary fun (sorry not sorry) ;)
