## What is a clef?

You learned in [the last lesson](/docs/concert-choir/book-1/unit-1/The Staff.mdx) that the staff is an empty canvas on which we can draw notes. Each line and space on a staff is assigned to a specific letter from the musical alphabet. The clef determines placement of each letter.

There are many different clefs, but the two most common are the Treble or G Clef and the Bass or F Clef.
